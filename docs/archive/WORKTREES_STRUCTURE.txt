Quick Navigation
================

Go to recommended worktree (Hybrid approach):
    cd /Users/abhilashchadhar/uncloud/chipos-worktrees/aceternity-ui

Go to safest worktree (Park UI):
    cd /Users/abhilashchadhar/uncloud/chipos-worktrees/park-ui

Read comparison:
    cat /Users/abhilashchadhar/uncloud/chipos-worktrees/comparison/UI_LIBRARY_COMPARISON.md

List all worktrees:
    git worktree list

Recommended Path
================

Step 1: Read comparison (5 minutes)
    → /Users/abhilashchadhar/uncloud/chipos-worktrees/comparison/UI_LIBRARY_COMPARISON.md

Step 2: Choose strategy based on timeline
    - 2-3 days? → park-ui worktree (Park UI only)
    - 1-2 weeks? → aceternity-ui worktree (Hybrid: Park + Aceternity) 🏆
    - 2 weeks?   → aceternity-ui or magic-ui (Aceternity or Magic only)
    - 3 weeks?   → nextui worktree (Complete NextUI rewrite)

Step 3: Go to chosen worktree
    cd /Users/abhilashchadhar/uncloud/chipos-worktrees/[worktree]

Step 4: Read setup guide
    cat [LIBRARY]_SETUP.md

Step 5: Start implementing
    Follow the checklist in the setup guide
